# ML Model Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the ML-based internship matching system to better align with the rule-based system and user requirements.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Skills-Based Matching
- Enhanced the model to consider user skills when generating recommendations
- Combined skills, education, and preferences for more accurate matching
- Improved TF-IDF vectorization to include skills in the feature space

### 2. Domain Priority Logic
- Implemented logic to ensure the first recommendation comes from the user's preferred domain
- Subsequent recommendations (2nd and 3rd) are based on skills matching across all domains
- Maintains domain preference while leveraging skills for broader opportunities

### 3. Location Handling
- Improved remote work filtering to ensure appropriate recommendations
- Better handling of location constraints with fallback to remote options
- Proper error handling when no internships are available in specified locations

### 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases
- Enhanced handling of non-existent domains (returns empty recommendations)
- Better location filtering with appropriate fallbacks
- Improved messaging for edge cases

## Technical Implementation

### Feature Engineering
- Combined user features: Education + Skills + PreferredDomain + PreferredLocation
- Combined internship features: Company + Role + Domain + Location
- Used TF-IDF vectorization for text-based similarity matching

### Recommendation Logic
1. **First Recommendation**: From preferred domain with highest similarity score
2. **Subsequent Recommendations**: Based on skills matching across all domains
3. **Location Filtering**: Respects user location preferences with remote fallback
4. **Enrollment Rules**: Applied matching logic from rule-based system

### Edge Case Handling
- Non-existent domains: Returns empty recommendations
- No internships in preferred location: Falls back to remote options
- Insufficient domain matches: Fills with skills-based recommendations

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Domain Preference
- ✅ First recommendation correctly from preferred domain (AI)
- ✅ Subsequent recommendations based on skills matching

### Test 2: Remote Location Preference
- Mixed results - some recommendations are remote, others may be location-matched
- Improvement opportunity for stricter remote filtering

### Test 3: Non-existent Domain
- ✅ Correctly returns no recommendations

### Test 4: Unavailable Location
- ✅ Handles gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

## Future Improvements

1. **Stricter Location Filtering**: Enhance remote-only filtering when specifically requested
2. **Advanced Skills Matching**: Implement more sophisticated skills matching algorithms
3. **Personalization**: Add user feedback learning to improve recommendations over time
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize vectorization and similarity calculations for faster responses

## Integration with Rule-Based System

The improved ML model now better aligns with the rule-based system by:
- Respecting domain preferences as the primary filter
- Incorporating skills matching for broader opportunities
- Applying similar location and enrollment rules
- Providing detailed reasoning for recommendations
