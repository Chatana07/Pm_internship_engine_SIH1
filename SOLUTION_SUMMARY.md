# Solution Summary

## Problem
The AI recommendation system was not working properly when users clicked the "Get AI Recommendations" button on the frontend. The system was returning errors related to user not found and path issues.

## Root Causes Identified
1. Path issues in the backend API server when running from different directories
2. Temporary user creation and dataset loading problems
3. ML model not properly reloading with updated data

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Path Issues
- Updated the API server to correctly resolve paths to dataset files regardless of where it's run from
- Added proper path resolution for ML model files

### 2. Improved Temporary User Handling
- Modified the approach to handle temporary users without modifying dataset files
- Added a new method `get_recommendations_for_profile` to the MLInternshipMatcher that can generate recommendations for a user profile directly without modifying datasets

### 3. Enhanced ML Model Integration
- Fixed the ML model loading process
- Added debugging information to help troubleshoot issues
- Ensured the model properly initializes with dataset files

### 4. Updated Frontend Integration
- Verified the frontend JavaScript properly handles API responses
- Confirmed the modal display for recommendations works correctly

### 5. Improved Documentation
- Updated README with comprehensive usage instructions
- Added clear steps for starting the application
- Documented API endpoints and testing procedures

### 6. Created Startup Script
- Developed a script to easily start both frontend and backend components
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

## Testing
The solution has been tested and verified to work correctly:
- Backend API server starts successfully
- Health endpoint responds correctly
- AI recommendation endpoint generates personalized internship recommendations
- Frontend properly displays recommendations in a modal
- Startup script launches both components correctly

## How to Use
1. Run `python start_application.py` to start both frontend and backend
2. Navigate to the AI Recommendations page in the frontend
3. Fill out the form with your details
4. Click "Get AI Recommendations" to receive personalized internship matches
5. View your recommendations in the modal that appears

## API Endpoints
- `GET http://localhost:5000/health` - Health check
- `POST http://localhost:5000/ai_recommend` - AI recommendations based on user profile

## Technologies Used
- Python Flask for backend API
- scikit-learn for ML-based recommendations
- JavaScript for frontend interactions
- HTML/CSS for user interface
- Pandas for data processing
