# üéØ Internship Matching System

A lightweight machine learning-based system for intelligently matching students with internship opportunities based on their preferences, enrollment status, and comprehensive matching rules.

## üìã Overview

This system implements both rule-based and ML-based approaches to recommend the top 3 most suitable internships for students. It considers multiple factors including domain preferences, location requirements, duration matching, enrollment status, and provides stipend-based ranking with detailed explanations for each recommendation.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

```
CSV Data ‚Üí InternshipMatcher (Business Logic) ‚Üí API Server (Flask) ‚Üí JSON Response
```

- **Data Layer**: CSV files for user profiles and internship data
- **Business Logic**: Core matching engine with filtering rules
- **API Layer**: Flask-based REST API with multiple endpoints
- **Demo Interface**: Interactive testing and demonstration module

## üìä Datasets

### User Dataset (100 profiles)
- **UserID**: Unique identifier
- **Education**: Educational background
- **Skills**: Technical and soft skills
- **PreferredDomain**: Desired internship domain
- **PreferredLocation**: Preferred work location
- **InternshipDuration**: Desired duration
- **EnrollmentStatus**: Current enrollment (Full-time/Part-time/Remote/Online)

### Internship Dataset (50 opportunities)
- **InternshipID**: Unique identifier
- **Company**: Organization name
- **Role**: Job title
- **Domain**: Work domain
- **Location**: Work location
- **Type**: Full-time or Part-time
- **Duration**: Internship duration
- **Stipend**: Compensation amount

## üß† Matching Algorithm

### 1. Domain Filtering
- Exact match between user's preferred domain and internship domain
- Domains: AI, Data Science, Business Analyst, UI/UX Designer, Graphics Designer, Web Development, Finance

### 2. Location Filtering
- Direct location match (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Remote)
- Remote internships are offered if no direct location match
- Users preferring remote get all remote opportunities

### 3. Duration Filtering
- Exact match between preferred duration and internship duration
- Common durations: 3 months, 6 months, 12 months

### 4. Enrollment Rules
- **Full-time students** ‚Üí **Part-time internships**
- **Part-time students** ‚Üí **Full-time internships**
- **Remote/Online students** ‚Üí **Full-time internships**

### 5. Stipend Ranking
- Internships ranked by compensation (highest first)
- Unpaid internships ranked lowest
- Numerical extraction from stipend strings

### 6. Top 3 Selection
- Best 3 matches based on above criteria
- Each recommendation includes detailed reasoning

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy flask flask-cors scikit-learn
```

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Test the Core Matching System
```python
from backend.internship_matcher import InternshipMatcher

# Initialize matcher
matcher = InternshipMatcher(
    user_dataset_path='dataset/user_profile_dataset_100.csv',
    internship_dataset_path='dataset/internship_dataset_50.csv'
)

# Get recommendations for a user
matcher.print_recommendations(user_id=15)
```

#### 2. Run Interactive Demo
```bash
python backend/demo.py
```

#### 3. Start API Server
```bash
python backend/api_server.py
```
Server will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

#### 4. Validate System
```bash
python backend/validate.py
```

## ü§ñ ML-Based Matching System

The system now includes an enhanced ML-based matching system with improved recommendation accuracy.

2. The frontend will open automatically in your browser
3. Click on "AI Recommendations" in the navigation
4. Fill out the form with your details
5. Click "Get AI Recommendations" to receive personalized internship matches
6. View your recommendations in the modal that appears

## üß™ Testing
